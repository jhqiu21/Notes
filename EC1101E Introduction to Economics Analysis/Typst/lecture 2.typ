= Demand

+ *Quantity demanded(Q#super[D]):* The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase.
+ *Demand schedule:* a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded
+ *Quantity demanded in the market:* The sum of the quantities demanded by all buyers at each price.
+ *Demand Curve:* Shows how price affects quantity demanded,other things equal
+ *Demand Curve Shifter:*

  - Two goods are *substitutes* if an *increase* in the price of one good causes a(n) *increase* in the demand for the other good.
  - Two goods are *complements* if an *increase* in the price of one good causes a(n) *decrease* in the demand for the other good.

= Supply

+ *Quantity Supplied(Q#super[S]):* The amount of the good that sellers are willing and able to sell.
  - Price$arrow.t$ $arrow.r.double.long$ Q#super[S]$arrow.b$
+ *Supply schedule:* a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied  
+ *Quantity supplied in the market:* the sum of the quantities supplied by all sellers at each price
+ *Supply Curve Shifters:*

  - *Weather:*
    - Ideal weather conditions bring a bumper harvest of sweet and rosy apples; the S curve shifts *right*. 
    - Freezing temperatures in California damage the stateâ€™s citrus crops; the S curve shifts *left*.
  - *Expectations:* Events in the Middle East lead to expectations of higher oil prices. In response, oil fields in Brunei reduce supply now, saving some inventory to sell later when prices are higher. The S curve shifts *left*.



= Supply and Demand

+ *Equilibrium:* a state in which opposing forces are balanced so that one is not greater than the other.
+ *Surplus (excess supply):* when Q#super[S] $gt$ Q#super[D]
+ *Shortage (excess demand):* when Q#super[S] $lt$ Q#super[D]
+ *Shifts vs. Movements:*
  - *Supply:* A shift in the S curve occurs when a non-price determinant of supply changes.
  - *Quantity Supplied:* A movement along a fixed S curve occurs when P changes. 
  - *Demand:* A shift in the D curve occurs when a non-price determinant of demand changes.
  - *Quantity Demanded:* A movement along a fixed D curve occurs when P changes. 



= Exercise
